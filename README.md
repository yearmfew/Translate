# Translate
A translator with vue -js and yandex translate api.
I have first watched a video tutorial about it and developed after the video tutorial.
I have added additional functionality like, tabs, delete option and some changes about the theme of the app. 
The original video tutorial is Gökhan Kandemir's Udemy Vue.js course.
